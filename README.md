Hi,

I am Anna from Krakow, Poland.

I am currently expanding my knowledge in marketing and graphic design. As for front-end development, you may notice that the content here isn’t presented in a strict chronological order. I don’t upload all my projects, and I’m aware that some aspects—whether in appearance or code—might not be perfect (sometimes it’s a matter of prioritizing my time). I’ll continue refining it to make everything increasingly user-friendly.

I am interested in many things. Among them: cognitive science, personal development, health, the information bubble, crime / detective novels, Harumi Murakami (some of his books), parenting, computer graphics, marketing and many other things that could affect me ...

I have so many ideas that I would like to create further ... The older I am, the younger I feel ;-)


Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
