Hello You, 

I’m Anna from Kraków.

I am currently learning React, but also I came back to basic knowledge which I didn't use for longer time. So here you will find thing not in historical order. It can be a little messy. ;-)

I am also currently working on JavaScript for Adobe Illustrator which can speed my work as prepress specialist.


I’m interested in many things. Among them cognitive science, personal development, information bubble, crime/detective novels, Harumi Murakami (some of his books), parenting, computer graphics and many onther things which can have impact on me.


Have a good day!
