Hello You, 

I’m Anna from Kraków. The older I am, the younger I feel ;-)

I am currently learning React, but also I came back to basic knowledge which I didn't use for longer time. So here you will find things not in historical order. So it can be a little messy. I am not posting all of my works.

I am also currently working on JavaScript for Adobe Illustrator which can speed my work as prepress specialist.


I’m interested in many things. Among them cognitive science, personal development, information bubble, crime/detective novels, Harumi Murakami (some of his books), parenting, computer graphics and many other things which can have impact on me...

I have so many ideas what I would like to create next...


Thanks for reading 🏋️‍♀️


Have a good day!
