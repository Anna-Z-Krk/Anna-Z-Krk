Hi,

I am Anna from Krakow.

Currently, I am learning React, but I am also going back to the basic knowledge that I have not used for a long time. So here you will find things that are not historically in order. So it can be a bit of a mess. I do not post all my works here, I am aware of the imperfect appearance / code here (sometimes it's just a calculation of my time).

I am interested in many things. Among them, cognitive science, personal development, health, the information bubble, crime / detective novels, Harumi Murakami (some of his books), parenting, computer graphics and many other things that could affect me ...

I have so many ideas that I would like to create further ... The older I am, the younger I feel ;-)


Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
